[Lunch Checker App](https://kimberlythegeek.github.io/coursera-angular-js/module1-solution/)

A very simple app that checks if you are eating too much food, by saying
"Too Much!" if you enter more than 3 items.

As a bonus, I coded it such that blank items, such as ",," or any amount of whitespace between commas, ",   ," does _not_ count towards the total.
