[Shopping List App - Alternate Implementation](https://kimberlythegeek.github.io/coursera-angular-js/module2-solution/alternate-implementation/)

This assignment was a little more complex, but still did not take much time
to complete. I did not use the start code, but started it from scratch for the practice,
using the example code as reference.


__Create a "check off" shopping list application.__

1. Your HTML page should display 2 lists, one titled "To Buy" and the other
"Already Bought".

2. The "To Buy" list should be pre-populated with a list of at least 5 items.

3. Next to each item in the list should be a button with the label "Bought".
When the user clicks on the "Bought" button, its associated item should be
removed from the "To Buy" list and appear in the "Already Bought" list.

4.
